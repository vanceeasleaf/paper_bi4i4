The method allows high-quality first-principles molecular-dynamics calculations to be performed using the original fictitious Lagrangian approach of Car and Parrinello. Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation.},

abstract = {The phonon and electron transport in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are investigated using the nonequilibrium Green's function approach. In zigzag SWCNT ({\$}n{\$}, 0) with {\$}mod(n,3)\backslashnot=0{\$}, the thermal conductance is mainly attributed to the phonon transport, while the electron only has few percentage contribution. The maximum value of the figure of merit ({\$}ZT{\$}) is about 0.2 in this type of SWCNT. The {\$}ZT{\$} is considerably larger in narrower SWCNT because of enhanced Seebeck coefficient. {\$}ZT{\$} is smaller in the armchair SWCNT, where Seebeck coefficient is small due to zero band gap. It is found that the cluster isotopic doping can reduce the phonon thermal conductance obviously and enhance the value of {\$}ZT{\$}. The uniaxial elongation and compress strain depresses phonons in whole frequency region, leading to the reduction of the phonon thermal conductance in whole temperature range. Interestingly, the elongation strain can affect the phonon transport more seriously than the compress strain, because the high frequency {\$}G{\$} mode is completely filtered out under elongation strain {\$}\backslashepsilon {\textgreater}0.05{\$}. The strain also has important effect on the subband edges of the electron band structure by smoothing the steps in the electron transmission function. The {\$}ZT{\$} is decreased by strain as the reduction in the electronic conductance overcomes the reduction in the thermal conductance.},

Even though texturing was effective in improving peak ZT of Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 from 0.85 to 1.04, reproducibility from batch to batch remains unsatisfactory.

It is now possible to compute these forces from scratch, and to perform dynamical simulations of the atomic motion under current. One reason for this interest is that current can be a destructive force—it can cause atoms to migrate, resulting in damage and in the eventual failure of the conductor. But one can also ask, can current be made to do useful work on atoms? In particular, can an atomic-scale motor be driven by electrical current, as it can be by other mechanisms? For this to be possible, the current-induced forces on a suitable rotor must be non-conservative, so that net work can be done per revolution. Here we show that current-induced forces in atomic wires are not conservative and that they can be used, in principle, to drive an atomic-scale waterwheel.},

@article{Autes2015,
abstract = {Recent progress in the field of topological states of matter 1,2 has largely been initiated by the discovery of bismuth and antimony chalcogenide bulk topological insulators (TIs; refs 3–6), followed by closely related ternary compounds 7–16 and predictions of several weak TIs (refs 17–19). However, both the conceptual richness of Z 2 classification of TIs as well as their structural and compositional diversity are far from being fully exploited. Here, a new Z 2 topological insulator is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed in the $\beta$-phase of quasi-one-dimensional bismuth iodide Bi 4 I 4 . The electronic structure of $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 , characterized by Z 2 invariants (1;110), is in proximity of both the weak TI phase (0;001) and the trivial insulator phase (0;000). Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements performed on the (001) surface reveal a highly anisotropic band-crossing feature located at the M point of the surface Brillouin zone and showing no dispersion with the photon energy, thus being fully consistent with the theoretical prediction. The $\beta$-phase of the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) bismuth iodide Bi 4 I 4 crystallizes in a monoclinic base-centred lattice (space group C12/m1 (No. 12), a = 14.386 {\AA}, b = 4.430 {\AA}, c = 10.493 {\AA} and $\beta$ = 107.9 •), with the structure shown in Fig. 1a (ref. 20). $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 belongs to a family of bismuth-rich iodides, which also includes $\alpha$-Bi 4 I 4 , Bi 14 I 4 , Bi 16 I 4 and Bi 18 I 4 , all composed of one-dimensional molecular fragments held together by weaker non-covalent interactions 21 . Two modifications of the Bi 4 I 4 crystal structure, $\alpha$-and $\beta$-, arise from the differing stacking of molecular chains, whose structure and composition remain unchanged. The 1D building blocks of $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 , aligned along the b axis, can be viewed as narrow nanoribbons of a bismuth bilayer (four Bi atoms in width) terminated by iodine atoms (Fig. 1b). The crystal structure of $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 features two types of non-equivalent bismuth atoms: peripheral Bi A atoms saturated by covalent bonds to four iodine atoms and inner Bi B atoms which bind only to three bismuth atoms. Previously reported crystal-growth techniques 20,22 were optimized to produce $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 single crystals up to 10 × 1 × 0.5 mm in size (Fig. 1c and Methods). The crystals demonstrate a high degree of crystalline order with no intergrown domains, stacking faults or other defects (Supplementary Information). The material thus seems to be practically free of defects, which implies a low concentration of intrinsic charge carriers. The anisotropy of the $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 crystal structure is reflected in the needle-like shape of the single crystals. The longest dimension corresponds to the b axis—that is, oriented along the one-dimensional chains. Closer inspection of the crystals reveals the presence of cleavage planes parallel to that direction (Fig. 1d). The motivation for the experimental investigation was the result of first-principles electronic structure calculations showing that $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 would exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase (see Methods and Supplementary Information). The electronic band structure of $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 calculated using the density functional theory (DFT) approach, along a path in k-space including all inequivalent time-reversal invariant momentum (TRIM) points in the bulk BZ (indicated in Fig. 2a), is shown in Fig. 2b (dashed lines). These calculations predict an indirect band gap of 0.158 eV, with a valence band (VB) maximum at the point and a conduction band (CB) minimum at the M point. The band dispersion is relatively weak along the AYM path, which corresponds to the inter-chain bonding directions, and strong along the B direction oriented parallel to the chains, thus reflecting the quasi-1D character of $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 . This compound has a centrosymmetric crystal structure, hence its Z 2 topological invariants ($\nu$ 0 ;$\nu$ 1 $\nu$ 2 $\nu$ 3) can be computed using the method of Fu and Kane 23 . According to our DFT calculations, $\beta$-Bi 4 I 4 would be a weak TI with the Z 2 indices (0;001). The topological non-triviality of this material stems from the spin–orbit-induced band inversion at the M and Y TRIM points (Fig. 2c). The contributing electronic states are bismuth p orbitals of even parity, localized on Bi A atoms (Bi A p +), and of odd parity, localized on Bi B atoms (Bi B p −), as was also shown for Bi 4 Br 4 , which has isostructural quasi-1D building blocks 24 . However, according to the DFT calculations of ref. 24, bulk Bi 4 Br 4 is a trivial insulator owing to a different packing of chains.},

abstract = {Approximately 90 per cent of the world's power is generated by heat engines that use fossil fuel combustion as a heat source and typically operate at 30 - 40 per cent efficiency, such that roughly 15 terawatts of heat is lost to the environment. Thermoelectric modules could potentially convert part of this low- grade waste heat to electricity. Their efficiency depends on the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT of their material components, which is a function of the Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity and absolute temperature. Over the past five decades it has been challenging to increase ZT {\textgreater} 1, since the parameters of ZT are generally interdependent(1). While nanostructured thermoelectric materials can increase ZT {\textgreater} 1 ( refs 2 - 4), the materials ( Bi, Te, Pb, Sb, and Ag) and processes used are not often easy to scale to practically useful dimensions. Here we report the electrochemical synthesis of large- area, wafer- scale arrays of rough Si nanowires that are 20-300 nm in diameter. These nanowires have Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity values that are the same as doped bulk Si, but those with diameters of about 50 nm exhibit 100- fold reduction in thermal conductivity, yielding ZT = 0.6 at room temperature. For such nanowires, the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity approaches the amorphous limit for Si, which cannot be explained by current theories. Although bulk Si is a poor thermoelectric material, by greatly reducing thermal conductivity without much affecting the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity, Si nanowire arrays show promise as high- performance, scalable thermoelectric materials.},

abstract = {The thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit ZT of topological insulator Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, and Bi2Se3 thin film quantum wells is calculated for thicknesses below 10 nm, for which hybridization of the surface states as well as quantum confinement in the bulk are individually predicted to enhance ZT. Here, the question is addressed what ZT can be expected from coexisting surface and bulk states in such quantum wells. It is demonstrated that the parallel contributing bulk and surface channels tend to cancel each other out. This is because the surface-to-volume ratios of the thin films prevent the domination of transport through a single channel and because the individual bulk and surface ZTs are optimized at different Fermi levels.},

@article{Boukai2008,
abstract = {Thermoelectric materials interconvert thermal gradients and electric fields for power generation or for refrigeration. Thermoelectrics currently find only niche applications because of their limited efficiency, which is measured by the dimensionless parameter ZT-a function of the Seebeck coefficient or thermoelectric power, and of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Maximizing ZT is challenging because optimizing one physical parameter often adversely affects another. Several groups have achieved significant improvements in ZT through multi-component nanostructured thermoelectrics, such as Bi(2)Te(3)/Sb(2)Te(3) thin-film superlattices, or embedded PbSeTe quantum dot superlattices. Here we report efficient thermoelectric performance from the single-component system of silicon nanowires for cross-sectional areas of 10 nm x 20 nm and 20 nm x 20 nm. By varying the nanowire size and impurity doping levels, ZT values representing an approximately 100-fold improvement over bulk Si are achieved over a broad temperature range, including ZT approximately 1 at 200 K. Independent measurements of the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, combined with theory, indicate that the improved efficiency originates from phonon effects. These results are expected to apply to other classes of semiconductor nanomaterials.},

@article{Li2014,
abstract = {ShengBTE is a software package for computing the lattice thermal conductivity of crystalline bulk materials and nanowires with diffusive boundary conditions. It is based on a full iterative solution to the Boltzmann transport equation. Its main inputs are sets of second- and third-order interatomic force constants, which can be calculated using third-party ab-initio packages. Dirac delta distributions arising from conservation of energy are approximated by Gaussian functions. A locally adaptive algorithm is used to determine each process-specific broadening parameter, which renders the method fully parameter free. The code is free software, written in Fortran and parallelized using MPI. A complementary Python script to help compute third-order interatomic force constants from a minimum number of ab-initio calculations, using a real-space finite-difference approach, is also publicly available for download. Here we discuss the design and implementation of both pieces of software and present results for three example systems: Si, InAs and lonsdaleite.
